## Overview
Dioxus is a powerful fullstack application framework designed for web, desktop, and mobile development. It combines the best of modern technologies, allowing developers to build efficient and user-friendly applications. Whether you're creating a simple web app or a complex mobile solution, Dioxus provides the tools you need to succeed.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Build applications that run on Android, iOS, and desktop environments.
- **Fast Development**: Leverage a virtual DOM for quick rendering and updates.
- **Native Performance**: Write in Rust and enjoy the performance benefits of native applications.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve load times and SEO with SSR capabilities.
- **Rich UI Components**: Use pre-built components to create stunning user interfaces with ease.
- **WebAssembly Support**: Take advantage of WebAssembly for high-performance applications.

## Installation
To get started with Dioxus, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3bk-dev/dioxus.git
   cd dioxus
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

For more detailed instructions, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/3bk-dev/dioxus/releases).

## Getting Started
Once you have Dioxus installed, you can start building your application. Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
dioxus new my-app
```

Navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Start the development server:

```bash
dioxus serve
```

You can now access your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Dioxus allows you to create components easily. Here's a simple example of a functional component:

```rust
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            h1 { "Welcome to Dioxus!" }
            p { "This is a simple component." }
        }
    })
}
```

### Key Concepts
- **Components**: The building blocks of your application. Create reusable components to keep your code organized.
- **Props**: Pass data to components using props. This allows for dynamic rendering based on user input or other data sources.
- **State Management**: Use Dioxus's built-in state management features to handle application state effectively.

## Directory Structure
Here's an overview of the typical directory structure in a Dioxus project:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs        # Entry point of the application
│   ├── components/     # Custom components
│   └── assets/         # Static assets (images, styles, etc.)
├── Cargo.toml          # Project configuration
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```
